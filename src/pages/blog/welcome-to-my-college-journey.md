## __Why I went with my course__


I chose a T-level since I knew it was going to be a lot of work to do, however at the end it is worth it since, at the the time of writing this, it will be worth to about **3 A Levels**.

> "T Levels are new 2-year courses which are taken after GCSEs and are broadly equivalent in size to 3 A Levels. Launched in September 2020, these courses have been developed in collaboration with employers and education providers so that the content meets the needs of industry and prepares students for entry into skilled employment, an apprenticeship or related technical study through further or higher education."

This is great since I get to do work placement whilest specialising in a subject in IT, which the category I choose to specialise in is Business Support. This course may sound boring with its name, however it is amazing the topic you cover whilest learning *(The name may be different depending on the college you go to)*.

## __Why I went with Digital Support Services__

As I briefly mentioned in the previous section, the name of the course sound boring, however it has some fun topics to learn about in it. 
<br />

__Paper 1 will include the following:__

    1. Business context including business environment, digital value to business, technical change management and risks in a business context.

    2. Culture including moral and ethical issues.

    3. Data including data and information in organisations, data formats, data systems and data management.

    4. Digital analysis including computational thinking and use of algorithms. Digital environments including physical environments, networks, virtual environments, cloud environments and resilience of environments.
    
    5. Diversity and inclusion including digital inclusion and impact of non-inclusive digital practices.

    6. Learning including emerging trends and technologies.

    7. Legislation including relevant legislation, guidelines and code of conduct.

    8. Planning including project planning, life cycle management and quality management.

    9. Security including security risks and threat mitigation.

    10. Testing including root cause analysis and testing methods.

    11. Tools including presentation tools, project management methodologies, evaluation tools and collaborative communication tools.

<br />

__Furthermore, Paper 2 will include the following:__

    1. Careers within the digital support services sector.

    2. Communication in digital support services including communication formats and interactions between digital support services and clients/colleagues.

    3. Fault analysis and problem resolution including fault analysis tools, frameworks for problem management, root cause analysis and incident management.

This covers the two papers that will be assested during the course. It is a full-time course that does have work placement as mentioned in the previous section. This course covers topics from: __networking, cyber security & much more__, which is great since it has what I need for my career path.

## __Conclusion__

To end this post of, I would like to say that any projects will be available for you to look at and see how I improve. At the end of my college journey I will tell you if it is worth it or should you go for a normal grade _(e.g. A Level, BTEC)_. That will be all for this installment of my college journey, see you next time!

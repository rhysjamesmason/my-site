## **Why I went with my course**

I chose a T-level since I knew it was going to be a lot of work to do, however in the end it is worth it since, at the time of writing this, it will be worth to about __3 A Levels__.

> "T Levels are new 2-year courses which are taken after GCSEs and are broadly equivalent in size to 3 A Levels. Launched in September 2020, these courses have been developed in collaboration with employers and education providers so that the content meets the needs of industry and prepares students for entry into skilled employment, an apprenticeship or related technical study through further or higher education."

This is great since it will allow me to do work placement while specializing in a subject in IT, which is the category I have chosen to specialize in. The course may sound boring by its name; however, it is amazing how much you learn about the topic. _(The name may be different depending on the college you go to)_.

## **Why I went with Digital Support Services**

As I briefly mentioned in the previous section, the name of the course may seem boring, but it actually has some interesting topics to learn about.
<br />

**The first paper will include the following:**

    1. Business context including business environment, digital value to business, technical change management and risks in a business context.

    2. Culture including moral and ethical issues.

    3. Data including data and information in organisations, data formats, data systems and data management.

    4. Digital analysis including computational thinking and use of algorithms. Digital environments including physical environments, networks, virtual environments, cloud environments and resilience of environments.

    5. Diversity and inclusion including digital inclusion and impact of non-inclusive digital practices.

    6. Learning including emerging trends and technologies.

    7. Legislation including relevant legislation, guidelines and code of conduct.

    8. Planning including project planning, life cycle management and quality management.

    9. Security including security risks and threat mitigation.

    10. Testing including root cause analysis and testing methods.

    11. Tools including presentation tools, project management methodologies, evaluation tools and collaborative communication tools.

<br />

**Furthermore, Paper 2 will include the following:**

    1. Careers within the digital support services sector.

    2. Communication in digital support services including communication formats and interactions between digital support services and clients/colleagues.

    3. Fault analysis and problem resolution including fault analysis tools, frameworks for problem management, root cause analysis and incident management.

This covers the two papers that will be used to evaluate your progress throughout the course. As mentioned in the previous section, the course is full-time and does have a work placement component. This course covers topics from networking, cybersecurity, and much more. That's great, since it has what I need for my career path.

## **What are my plans in the future?**

My future career goal is to become a network administrator for a company, regardless of its size. I feel this is a perfect role for me, considering my interest in networks and how stuff works, as well as my past aspirations of working in this field.

## **What are my plans in this site?**

This site is solely dedicated to documenting my time at college and my course. This will be a space where I will share updates on what's happening and new things I learn. I will use it to keep you informed. The site will be constantly updated to maintain a fresh and new feel. Some posts may include interactive demos or descriptions of how new technology would work.

## **Conclusion**

To conclude this post, I would like to say that any projects you look at will be available for you to see how I have improved. At the end of my college journey, I will let you know if it was worth it or if you should just go for a normal grade (e.g. A Level, BTEC). That is all for this instalment of my college journey. I will see you next time!

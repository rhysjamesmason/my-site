## Monday 12th, September

On Monday, we were supposed to have our placement day, but since placements do not start until later on in the year, it was a day off for us. That day is currently devoid of anything being done, until placements are sorted out.

## Tuesday 13th, September

I arrived in town about 7 am and was supposed to be in college by 9. So, I went to a local Gregg's and ordered a pumpkin spice latte, then sat down in the new city centre. It was nice and peaceful to sit and relax, I was also texting people. Then, at 8:35, I left for college. I waited for time in the cafeteria, since it wasn't a long walk. Then my friend arrived, and we set off to our class.

Our class was moved to another room, on another floor, which we found to be quite annoying. However, we proceeded to the new room and took our seats. The register was taken by our teacher, and she got my name wrong. We learned about project management when we did the positives of the Burj Khalifa. Then, you could find a failed project, for example the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, and compare it to the successful project.

Two lessons on project management were given to us. The final thing was tutorial, where we discussed our enrichment, sexual wellbeing and support. After that, we went home for the day, but were given an assignment to finish the digital induction on the college's moodle.

I think that day was fun, except for the room change.

## Wednesday 14th, September

Today, I was not supposed to arrive until 10:15am, so I caught the bus at 8:22am, which was a good idea. I believe it was a good idea because the traffic into town was horrendous. However, when I arrived at the bus station/interchange, I immediately realized that I had forgotten to update this blog. After I finished typing the Monday section of the article, my friend came. We had reserved a spot in our enrichment program for the afternoon, which was the Film Club that started at 1:00 pm.

We went to class, which was on the ground floor of the building, where we met our teacher. He was explaining the terminology relating to the cloud, where you can deploy virtual machines over the internet. The terms was the following:

 1. **Rapid Elasticity –** It is a cloud computing term that means **scalable provisioning**. 

 2. **Ubiquitous Access –** It is a cloud computing term that means **widely accessible**.

 3. **Rapid Deployment –** It is a cloud computing term that means that we can access more resources faster over the cloud (internet).

 4. **On-demand Self Service** – Refers to the service provided by loud computing vendors that enables the provision of cloud resources on demand whenever they are required.

 5. **Resource Pooling** – Is a tern used to describe a situation which providers serve multiple clients, customers or “tenants” with provisional and scalable services.

 6. **Pay-as-you-Grow** – Is a payment method for cloud computing those charges based on usage.

 7. **Multi-tenancy** – Where the service is shared with other users (Shared Hosting)

 8. **Automation** –** Software-based solutions that automate installation, configuration and management processes of cloud computing.

 9. **Chargeback** – Is an accounting strategy that applies costs of IT hardware, software, cloud services, shared services to the business unit in which they are used.

 10. **Cloud bursting** – Is an application deployment technique in which an application runs in a private cloud.

 11. **Minimal management effort** – This means that cloud technologies should be made as automatic as possible.

Then we created a virtual machine (VM) of our own on Microsoft's Azure platform. After that, we examined different reasons why you would use the cloud. Then, after that, my friend and I went to the main building to use the computers to finish the required modules for the tutorial, and we wasted some time there. When noon arrived, we returned to the building and got snacks for Film Club. This week's film was a comedy, but the film was a bit bad, but it was a decent way to spend enrichment. Then I returned home.

It was a good day, and I was excited about the next.

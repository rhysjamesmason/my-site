I took pictures of a lot of the things you can see at Bletchley Park. If you would like to see the images taken, then [click here to view the images](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18063756328333851/).

## On the road again! 

Hi again! I went on a trip yesterday and am I writing this. It was fun to ride the park with my college. It was a two and a half hour ride from the college's main campus to Bletchley Park, we took a coach. Halfway through the journey, we stopped at a service station for a rest and to get some snacks for the other half of the journey.

## When we have arrived

When we arrived at Bletchley Park, we got off the bus and got split into two groups. I was with two of my friends, which was nice. Then our first activity was to go to this lesson about the past, present and future of encryption, which was fascinating due to it making us think about how quantum computers can break the modern encryptions way faster than normal systems. The lecturers stated that this generation is going to be the generation that will have to solve how we can encrypt data without quantum computers breaking the code. 

They also did an interactive demo on how encryption works by using an analogy with a box, padlocks, multiple keys. However, I will not spoil the lesson, but I will recommend going to experience it since it gets you thinking.

## Free roam of the huts!

We went through huts, that was like if you had a personal time machine back to when it was in operation. The smell was old, dusty and the lighting was old and rustic, with the furniture being as it was back them. The historic events that went on in like you are re living it, however quiet and isolated, with no human in sight.

## Guided tour of the history of the place.

We had a guided tour that told us the sad, scary parts about the park. The idea that the people who worked here could not talk about what they were doing, or know what the other huts were doing. Most of the people who worked here was female, some was male. Due to them not being able to speak about what they did at the park, they were called cowards since they were thought to have done “nothing” in the war. But that was far from true. So my final thing I am going to ask you, can you crack this code?
